This design is based on the simple lasercut design, but adds another hole at the front, positioned over the SDR chip. This allows you to add some heat sinks to the chip, as it gets quite hot when the rad1o is used as an SDR. The normal case does not allow for any significant ventilation, which means that the whole rad1o heats up a lot when operating for any longer amount of time.

The rest of the case is identical to the basic lasercut design.
